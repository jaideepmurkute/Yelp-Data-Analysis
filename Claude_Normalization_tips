IMPORTANT NOTE: 
    It's important to note that while normalization can improve data integrity and reduce redundancy, it may come at the cost of increased complexity and potential performance implications for certain types of queries. The appropriate level of normalization often depends on the specific use case and the trade-offs between data integrity, query performance, and storage requirements.
    
Based on the documentation and structure of the Yelp dataset, it appears to be partially normalized but not fully normalized to the Third Normal Form (3NF).

The Yelp dataset consists of several JSON files, each representing a different entity, such as businesses, users, reviews, and checkins. These files are relatively flat and do not contain nested data structures, which is a good starting point for normalization.

However, upon closer inspection, there are still some potential normalization issues present in the dataset:

Business.json: This file contains both business-specific data (name, address, categories) and review-related data (review counts, rating). The review-related data could potentially be separated into a different table to achieve further normalization.

Review.json: While the reviews are separated into their own file, there is still some redundancy present. For example, the business_id and user_id attributes are repeated for each review, which could be normalized by creating separate tables for businesses and users, and then linking them to the reviews table via foreign keys.

User.json: This file contains user information, including their review counts and average ratings. These review-related attributes could potentially be separated into a different table to improve normalization.

Checkin.json: This file contains checkin data, which includes both business and user identifiers. Depending on the use case, this information could potentially be further normalized by creating separate tables for checkins, businesses, and users, and establishing relationships between them.

To fully normalize the Yelp dataset to 3NF, you would likely need to create additional tables for entities like categories, neighborhoods, and potentially separate tables for attributes like review counts and ratings. The specific normalization approach would depend on the requirements and intended use of the data.
